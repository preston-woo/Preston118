## About

I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa with interests in software development and artificial intelligence. I have experience with programming in Python and C/C++.

I recently worked on a capstone project where my team and I designed and implemented reinforcement learning strategies for the ancient board game HūlīGutta (Tigers & Goats). I helped set up the game environment by encoding rules, developing agents with Python and OpenSpiel, and using 2-step look-ahead algorithms to optimize decision-making. This experience sharpened my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and technical communication while allowing me to apply classroom knowledge to a complex real-world challenge.
